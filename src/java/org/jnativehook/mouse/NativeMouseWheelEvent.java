/**
 * An event which indicates that the mouse wheel was rotated on the system.
 * This event is not limited to a particular component's scope or visibility.
 * <p>
 *
 * A <code>NativeMouseWheelEvent</code> object is passed to every
 * <code>NativeMouseWheelListener</code> object which is registered to receive
 * mouse wheel events using the
 * {@link GlobalScreen#addNativeMouseWheelListener(NativeMouseWheelListener)}
 * method. The <code>GlobalScreen</code> object then dispatches a
 * <code>NativeMouseWheelEvent</code> to each listener.
 * <p>
 *
 * Platforms offer customization of the amount of scrolling that should take
 * place when the mouse wheel is moved. The two most common settings are to
 * scroll a certain number of "units" (commonly lines of text in a text-based
 * component) or an entire "block" (similar to page-up/page-down). The
 * <code>NativeMouseWheelEvent</code> offers methods for conforming to the
 * underlying platform settings. These platform settings can be changed at any
 * time by the user. <code>NativeMouseWheelEvents</code> reflect the most recent
 * settings.
