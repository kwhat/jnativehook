/**
 * Void implementation of the <code>ExecutorService</code> used to dispatch native events directly on the operating
 * system's event delivery thread.  Because this queue does not hand off events to a different thread, it is important
 * that you do not block on native event callback functions as it will delay or prevent subsequent events from being
 * delivered by the operating system.  This dispatcher should only be used by those attempting to consume native events.
