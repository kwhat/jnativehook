## About
JNativeHook is a library to provide global keyboard and mouse listeners for
Java.  This will allow you to listen for global shortcuts or mouse motion that
would otherwise be impossible using pure Java.  To accomplish this task,
JNativeHook leverages platform-dependent native code through Java's native
interface to create low-level system-wide hooks and deliver those events to
your application.

The following events are available via their respective listeners.
* Key Press Events
* Key Release Events
* Key Typed Events
* Mouse Down Events
* Mouse Up Events
* Mouse Click Events
* Mouse Move Events
* Mouse Drag Events
* Mouse Wheel Events

In addition to global event listners, this library has the ability to post native events back to the native operating 
system.

## Licensing
JNativeHook is covered under *both* the [GNU General Public](COPYING.md) *and* 
[GNU Lesser General Public](COPYING.LESSER.md) Licenses as the latter is an extension of the former granting you 
additional distribution rights.  As I understand it, you may use this library in proprietary projects so long as it 
remains an external library with the same binary interface.  You may modify the source code of this library to fulfill 
a proprietary need, as long as that source code is made public under the aforementioned terms.  Please consult with a 
licenced attorney if you have licence compatibility questions or concerns.
